# Extracting data from SAP Success Factors using Azure Data Factory 
In this repository you will find an example of how to extract data from SAP Success Factors using Azure Data Factory.

## Prerequisite 
To do this demo it is required to have access to an Azure Data Factory instance and a sql database (e.g. azure sql database). 
It's highly recommended to deploy a new data factory for this demo.

## Configuration
1. Connect a freshly deployed Azure Data Factory to a fork of this repo or directly to this repo. 
Once completed you should be able to see a few pipelines and other necessary stuff needed by the demo. 

2. In the repo under the "SQL Setup" folder, Execute the two sql scripts against a sql instance. These scripts will populate some meta data tables and some sample data that will be used during the demo.
